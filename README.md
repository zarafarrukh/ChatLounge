## Project Information

### Step into ChatLounge, where gaming meets great conversation! 
ChatLounge is a robust chat server featuring multiple chat rooms and __gaming functionality__ powered by the Java WebSocket API. It facilitates seamless real-time communication among users, managing connections efficiently. Users can join existing rooms or create new ones. Moreover, users have the options to play games: Tic Tac Toe and a Word game.

Each chat room has a unique code for separate discussions. The server handles user authentication and authorization. Upon entering a room, users provide a username, receive a welcome message, and can exchange messages with timestamps.

### Games: In Tic Tac Toe, users select emojis as players and can send reaction emojis. Winning triggers a celebratory animation. In the Word game, users decipher scrambled words and submit guesses for victory. Multiple rounds ensure continuous engagement.

### This endeavor is the result of a collaborative effort harnessing the collective expertise of Zara Farrukh, Rabia Chattha, Syeda Bisha Fatima, and Manal Afzal.
